## 🎯 Mission Statement

Build a fully autonomous, institution‑grade AI trading system operated by a single human (you) and one AI (me). The goal is to rival the infrastructure, reliability and performance of top proprietary trading desks and hedge funds — without a team.

---

## 🔄 Phase Breakdown

### ✅ Phase 1: Pro‑Ready Core
* Modular AI pipeline with `main.py`
* Multiprocessing for accelerated backtests
* Walk‑forward cross‑validation
* Bootstrap CI for Sharpe/Returns
* Statistical testing of returns
* Model/result saving
* GitHub integration with version control
* Docker support

### 🔜 Phase 2: Execution‑Grade System (In Progress)
* Simulated paper execution engine (with slippage, latency)
* MT4 live price pull + signal match
* Risk engine (max daily loss, trailing drawdown)
* Trade logger & visual dashboard (PnL, exposure, equity curve)
* Telegram alerts (trade opens/closes)
* Broker connection abstraction layer

### 🔮 Phase 3: Scalable Alpha Engine
* Multi‑symbol, portfolio‑based backtests
* Dynamic position sizing + portfolio risk modelling
* Strategy vault (load strategies as modules)
* Regime detection (market states)
* Ensemble model voting

### 🚀 Phase 4: Autonomous Deployment & Expansion
* Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP ready)
* Live training/auto‑retraining loop
* Sentiment + macro news integration (paid API optional)
* Autonomous error detection + self‑healing logic
* Frontend UI (web or terminal‑based control)

## 🌱 Future Growth

* Use cloud GPUs for training deep models
* Add LLM‑based signal filtering (news/sentiment)
* Invite private investors with dashboards
* Automate strategy search & selection
* Optional: Hire team or remain 100% autonomous
